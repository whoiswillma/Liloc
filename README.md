## Tasks + Time Tracking

Liloc's goal is to combine the best of two services: Todoist and Toggl. On their own, each service lacks a core component of what I need to be productive:
* Todoist lacks self-reflection and productivity analysis features. *Was I more productive this week than last week?*
* Toggl lacks task management and future planning. *What do I need to do this week?*

Together, they form the ultimate duo for productivity.

## Getting Started

Liloc uses Carthage to manage its dependencies. To get started with Liloc:

1. Clone the repository
2. [Install Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage)
3. `$ carthage update --platform iOS` - This pulls dependencies and builds them. It'll probably take a while.
4. Open `Liloc.xcodeproj`
